**Red Wine Quality Analysis**

Hello!thank you for opening my project.I have done this project using python notebook in Google Colab.I have taken this (Red Wine Quality) dataset from a kaggle website.The link is https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009 .Our main aim is to build a machine learning model.In this the dataset can be viewed as classification or regression model.If the red wine quality is 7 or more than that,then the quality is said to be good/0.If the quality is less than 7,then the quality is considered to be bad/0.I have compared almost every classification model and regression model and come up with the results.
